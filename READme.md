# 📊 Student Insights: Institutional Data Analysis

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project showcases hands-on skill using **SAS**, **SQL**, and **Power BI** to clean, query, and visualize structured data. The goal is to explore student-related trends in enrollment, completions, retention, and staffing through real tools and processes.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **SAS Studio** – Importing, cleaning, transforming data, and generating summary outputs
- **SQL** – Recreating analyses from SAS using standard SQL logic
- **Power BI** – Dashboard visuals built from exported data
- **Excel/CSV** – Starting point for mock datasets
- **Git/GitHub** – Version control and portfolio presentation

## 📂 Datasets Used
- `Enrollment` – Yearly enrollment by gender, race/ethnicity, residency, age group, and distance learning status
- `Completions` – Program completions by gender, race, and program type over time
- `Retention` – Annual first-year retention and graduation rates
- `Staff` – Staff counts by year, role, and gender

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Areas
- Enrollment trends by demographic group and residency
- Completion patterns across academic programs
- Impact of COVID-19 on retention rates, including drop and recovery (peaked at 82% in 2022)
- Changes in university staffing over time by role

---

## 📈 Power BI Visuals
- **Stacked Bar**: Enrollment by residency (2019–2023)
- **Bar Chart**: Degree completions by program and year
- **Line Chart**: Retention and graduation rates (COVID drop and recovery)
- **Area Chart**: Staff roles by year

## 📝 Executive Summary
See `Report Summary.pdf` for a complete narrative interpretation of all key visuals, including trends and takeaways. The Word version is included for editing.

---

## 📌 Notes
This is a portfolio project using mock data to demonstrate data workflow and technical ability—not a real-world institutional analysis.
